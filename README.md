# CS50X

## Introduction to Computer Science (edX, Harvard)

### Overview
CS50X , Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of 
computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, 
with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by 
David J. Malan, CS50X teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve 
problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, 
encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web 
development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and 
HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, 
finance, forensics, and gaming. The on-campus version of CS50X , CS50, is 
Harvard's largest course.

### Objectives
Students who take CS50X learn:
- a broad and robust understanding of computer science and programming
- how to think algorithmically and solve programming problems efficiently
- concepts like abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, 
  resource management, security, software engineering, and web development
- familiarity in a number of languages, including C, Python, SQL, and 
  JavaScript plus CSS and HTML
- how to engage with a vibrant community of like-minded learners from all 
  levels of experience
- how to develop and present a final programming project to your peers

### Projects
CS50X includes ten lectures, each of which includes a problem set. The problem 
sets require students to apply the topics covered during the lectures in one or 
more projects. The course finishes with one final project.
