      <h3>THIS IS MY PROFESSIONAL PAGE!</h3>
      <p>I've worked in a variety of fields including hospitality, rehabilitation therapy and malaria research. Most recently I've decided to switch gears and pursue a career in computer science. See below for a timeline of some of my career milestones.</p>
      <h4>HOSPITALITY</h4>
      <div>
        <div style="float:left;">

          <p>I grew up in Edmonton (Canada) and spent my early days working as a hotel doorman at the Fairmont Hotel McDonald. I worked with a great team and had the opportunity to drive some schwanky cars and mingle with a-list celebrities.</p>

      <h4 style="padding-top:20px;">REHABILITATION THERAPY</h4>
      <div>
        <div style="float:left;">

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>I graduated from the University of Alberta with a BSc in Kinesiology and an MSc in Physical Therapy. After graduating I worked at the Royal Alexandra Hospital as a physical therapist in general medicine and orthopaedics. I also volunteered as physical therapist in Haiti, Boliva and Ecuador, mostly training local therapists and providing pediatric rehab.</p>

      <h4>MALARIA RESEARCH</h4>
      <div>
        <div style="float:left;">

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Not being satisfied working as a physical therapist, I decided to return to school where I could learn new skills to work on improving health in populations rather than individuals. I attended Tulane University in New Orleans (and also partook in a few Mardi Gras festivals) and completed an MPH in Global Health with a focus on Biostatistics and Epidemiology. Soon afterwards I relocated to Kenya where I was based while working on the ACTwatch project. ACTwatch was a project that measured malaria treament and diagnostic availabilty, price and market share in countries in Africa and Southeast Asia.

      <h4>COMPUTER SCIENCE</h4>

        <div>
          <p>Currently, I'm pursuing a career in computer science. I've been completing online tutorials/certificate and have developed basic skills in Bash, C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS and JS. I'm not exactly sure which area I'll specialize in but I am interested in software development and Articial Intelligence.</p>
